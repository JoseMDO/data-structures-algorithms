# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)
This repository contains notes on Data Structures and Algorithms written in Ruby.

## Debug gem

The debug gem allows you to add breakpoints in your code.

To use `debugger`, add `require 'debug'` at the top of the file and add `debugger` where you want to add the breakpoint.

## Test Driven Development (TDD)

DSA practice is a good opportunity to practice Test Driven Development (TDD).

Set up your test with the target method and the expected output. Run the test to see it fail. Write the method to make the test pass.

Tests can be added in the `tests` folder. Tests can be ran using the command `bundle exec ruby tests/test_file_name.rb`.
